# NouGenTube vs Glasp and NoteGPT

Compiled 2026-11-11 from each product's own public pages (Glasp: YouTube Summary, pricing, reader; NoteGPT: YouTube summarizer, transcript, AI notes, mind map, pricing). Summarised in our own words; raw page text is not kept in the repo.

Legend: **yes** = shipped, **partial** = shipped with a stated limit, **no** = not built, **n/a** = out of scope for a YouTube side panel.

## Where NouGenTube goes further (neither competitor has these)

- **Morph:** turns a video into a plan for code, an app, a site or a skill, built on the user's own vault, the live web and the 21 Valerion steps, with every citation verified in code.
- **Intelligence report with a deterministic checker:** quotes must appear verbatim in the transcript, timestamps must be inside the video, and a missing or cut-off section is flagged.
- **Shard:** one button saves the report and the full transcript to the user's own NouGenShards vault, so later videos and agents recall it.
- **Failsafe routes:** a transcript ladder of four tiers and a model ladder that moves on when a route fails or stays silent.
- **$0 by default:** local and free-fleet routes first; keys are the user's own and stay on the device or the local bridge.

## Gaps still open, in order of value

1. Transcribe videos with no captions (speech-to-text through the bridge).
2. Batch and playlist summaries.
3. Mind map PNG export and editing.
